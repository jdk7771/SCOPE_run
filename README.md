## 中文实验说明

中文分支说明、GOAT-Bench 实验结果、release 包结构和推荐结论见 [`各分支说明.md`](各分支说明.md)。

## Branch Guide / 分支说明

This fork keeps several experiment branches for GOAT-Bench navigation ablations.
The current logical branch map is:

```text
main
+-- baseline/fix-tsdf05cm
|   `-- feat/batch-frontier-potential-scoring
`-- feat/structured-bev-tsdf05cm
    `-- feat/metric-frontier-readable-bev
        `-- feat/semantic-bev-dedupe-smoothing
```

| Branch | Role | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | Original SCOPE baseline. It keeps the paper-style TSDF / scene graph / snapshot / frontier pipeline and the historical 10 cm TSDF GOAT-Bench setup. | Use as the reference implementation and for comparisons against the unmodified high-level VLM input. |
| `baseline/fix-tsdf05cm` | Stable 5 cm baseline line. It fixes stale snapshot object IDs, normalizes frontier handling for 5 cm TSDF, and records per-call VLM timing without adding structured BEV inputs. | Use as the matched non-BEV control for 5 cm TSDF experiments. |
| `feat/batch-frontier-potential-scoring` | Builds on `baseline/fix-tsdf05cm`. It batches newly observed frontier-potential scoring into one VLM request per step, then maps local `F_i` labels back to planner frontier IDs. Final snapshot/frontier decision logic stays baseline-compatible. | Use to measure latency and behavior of batched frontier scoring versus serial frontier-potential calls. |
| `feat/structured-bev-tsdf05cm` | First structured-BEV decision branch. It adds semantic BEV and Gaussian frontier-evidence BEV images to the high-level VLM prompt, uses structured JSON decisions, and keeps SCOPE TSDF planning/execution underneath. | Use as process code for isolating the effect of adding HSGM-style structured BEV context on top of 5 cm TSDF. |
| `feat/metric-frontier-readable-bev` | Main readable-BEV branch. It keeps 5 cm TSDF, changes frontier thresholds to metric units, makes semantic/Gaussian BEVs share the same crop and coordinates, validates semantic footprints against TSDF support, and uses structured VLM decisions. | Use as the main validated structured-BEV experiment branch. Existing reports show higher split 1/2/3 success than `baseline/fix-tsdf05cm`. |
| `feat/semantic-bev-dedupe-smoothing` | Readability follow-up to `feat/metric-frontier-readable-bev`. It deduplicates nearby same-class ConceptGraph tracks and adds display-only smoothing to TSDF-supported semantic footprints. It does not replace the planner or change the source TSDF/object mask. | Use when inspecting or rerunning the readable-BEV method with cleaner semantic instance rendering. |

GitHub now keeps only these six branches:

```text
main
baseline/fix-tsdf05cm
feat/batch-frontier-potential-scoring
feat/structured-bev-tsdf05cm
feat/metric-frontier-readable-bev
feat/semantic-bev-dedupe-smoothing
```

Active server worktrees on 2026-08-05:

| Path | Checked-out branch |
| --- | --- |
| `/mnt/data/SCOPE` | `baseline/fix-tsdf05cm` |
| `/mnt/data/SCOPE_batch_frontier_potential` | `feat/batch-frontier-potential-scoring` |
| `/mnt/data/SCOPE_metric_frontier_bev` | `feat/semantic-bev-dedupe-smoothing` |

The older `/mnt/data/SCOPE_run` and `/mnt/data/SCOPE_run_goal_bev` worktrees are
local archives only. Their legacy remote branches were removed on 2026-08-05 to
keep the GitHub branch list focused on the maintained experiment line.

## Installation

You can set up the conda environment either by following the step-by-step instructions below or by using the provided `environment.yml` file.

### Option 1: Step-by-step installation (Linux, CUDA 11.8, Python 3.9.21)

```bash
conda create -n scope python=3.9.21 -y && conda activate scope

conda install pytorch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 torchaudio==2.4.1  pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install -c conda-forge -c aihabitat habitat-sim=0.2.5 headless faiss-cpu=1.7.4 -y
conda install https://anaconda.org/pytorch3d/pytorch3d/0.7.8/download/linux-64/pytorch3d-0.7.8-py39_cu118_pyt241.tar.bz2 -y

pip install omegaconf==2.3.0 open-clip-torch==2.26.1 ultralytics==8.2.31 supervision==0.21.0 opencv-python-headless==4.10.* \
 scikit-learn==1.4 scikit-image==0.22 open3d==0.18.0 hipart==1.0.4 openai==1.35.3 httpx==0.27.2                                                      
```

### Option 2: Using environment.yml

We provide an `environment.yml` file for easy setup. This file includes all the dependencies (both conda and pip) and their versions.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate scope
```

> Note: The `environment.yml` file was generated on a Linux system with CUDA 11.8. If you are using a different system, you may need to adjust the CUDA version or the packages accordingly.


## Run Evaluation

### 1 - Preparations

#### Dataset
Please download the train and val split of [HM3D](https://aihabitat.org/datasets/hm3d-semantics/), and specify
the path in `cfg/eval_goatbench.yaml`. For example, if your download path is `/your_path/hm3d/` that 
contains `/your_path/hm3d/train/` and `/your_path/hm3d/val/`, you can set the `scene_data_path` in the config files as `/your_path/hm3d/`.

#### OpenAI API Setup
Please set up the endpoint and API key for the OpenAI API in `src/const.py`.

<!-- ### 2 - Run Evaluation on A-EQA

First run the following script to generate the predictions for the A-EQA dataset:

```bash
python run_aeqa_evaluation.py -cf cfg/eval_aeqa.yaml
```
To split tasks, you can add `--start_ratio` and `--end_ratio` to specify the range of tasks to evaluate. For example,
to evaluate the first half of the dataset, you can run:
```bash
python run_aeqa_evaluation.py -cf cfg/eval_aeqa.yaml --start_ratio 0.0 --end_ratio 0.5
```
After the scripts finish, the results from all splits will be automatically aggregated and saved.

To evaluate the predictions with the pipeline from OpenEQA, you can refer to [link](https://github.com/yyuncong/3D-Mem-AEQA-Eval) -->

### 2 - Run Evaluation on GOAT-Bench
You can directly run the following script:
```bash
python run_goatbench_evaluation.py -cf cfg/eval_goatbench.yaml
```
The results will be saved and printed after the script finishes.
